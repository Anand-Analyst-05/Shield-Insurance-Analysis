## 🧠 Project Summary

Shield Insurance had tons of raw data but lacked a single place to analyze customer behavior, regional performance, and sales trends.

As part of my virtual internship with **AtliQ Technologies**, I built a pilot Power BI dashboard that transformed their messy data into a set of clear, interactive views.

### The goal?
Help leadership make data-driven decisions faster by surfacing key customer and sales insights.

- 🧓 Identified key customer segments by age group
- 🛒 Analyzed sales performance by channel: Direct, Online, App, and Call Center
